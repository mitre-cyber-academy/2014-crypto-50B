This Repo contains both the QWERTY and DVORAK translations of the Dvorak Keyboard layout's wikipedia page. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard)
On the page, there is one instance of the word flag, which in the challenge was replaced with the flag as shown below.

Flag: da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709

# Note from Walker #
If someone could look over this that would be great as I may have done something wrong, or there is something I could have done better. Feel free to change anything or message me on Skype if anything needs to be fixed.

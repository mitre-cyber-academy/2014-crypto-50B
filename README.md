# Dvorak Substitution Cipher #

Description: This Repo contains both the QWERTY and DVORAK translations of the Dvorak Keyboard layout's wikipedia page. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard)
On the page, there is one instance of the word flag, which in the challenge was replaced with the flag as shown below.

Flag: da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709

Solution: 

1. Use a QWERTY to DVORAK translator (http://wbic16.xedoloh.com/dvorak.html) to translate to qwerty, then look for flag.

2. Manually translate from DVORAK to QWERTY, then look for the flag.

Note that the flag is replacing the word "flag" in the article.
